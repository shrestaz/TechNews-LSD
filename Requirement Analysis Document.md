--------------------------------------

**1. Introduction and Purpose**
“Tech News” is a web application system that enables its users to access different cool,  unusual, fun tech stories. It is a platform that aims to inspire everybody with idea, does not matter how crazy it is. From solar cells inspired from insect eyes to the latest smartphones and their perks. All users have to follow one big simple rule:

Post new, crazy, funky, fresh and offbeat tech material that even nobody probably thinks of. 

Some will ask : “What’s new and fresh for you?”
Answer: Everything that does not get their chance to be heard of, think of or talked about because it is too innovative. 
The most important idea of “Tech News” is to make everybody’s imagination boosted and triggered and show another different perspective.
To get everybody more involved “Tech News” gives you the opportunity to spread the news on social media and give more display to your ideas. 
The ultimate utopia point will be to create community that evaluates and gives valuable feedback to anybody posting, from people sitting home, start-up with big idea to well - established corporations that want to check out how their new feature perk will be accepted from the people that can think critically. The substance of the materials will not be strictly checked as “Tech News” values it’s freedom but if a material got marked as spam or violates simple human ethics it will got removed.

**2.4. Scenarios**

The following user scenarios portrays stories on how a user will interact with our application. With the help of these scenarios, we, as developers, get a clear view on the real life use cases, the usability of the application and its bottlenecks and the users’ motivations and intentions of using the application.


**2.4.1 Scenario 1: Registering as a new user.**


User Profile Targeted
New user interested in registering to interact with other users.
Subject Persona
Mary
Scenario Description
Signing up as a user

Background:
Mary is a Computer Science student who is a lurker of “Tech News” to get the relevant news regarding upcoming technologies and what’s new on software development field and the likes. So far, she only browsed the links posted by other users and read the comments posted by them.

Objective:
Mary wants to interact with other users by replying to their posts and comments, and also post links about new relevant articles she finds interesting and thinks others would benefit from.

Actions:
Mary visits the web application, like usual, and clicks on “log-in” button on the top right. Since she doesn’t have an account already, she fills up her information on the “Create Account” section with her username and password. With that filled in and submitting the information, she gets redirected to the home page, now with the ability to post links and comments and also vote.






**2.4.2 Scenario 2: Posting a Link to “Tech News”**

User Profile Targeted
Already registered and logged in user.
Subject Persona
Mary
Scenario Description
Creating a Post to “Tech News”

Mary is an user of “Tech News” who already performed the actions to register and log into the website. 

Objective:
Mary wants to share a tech article she wrote and deployed to her own server. Her idea is to post its link on “Tech News” so more people can see it. 

Actions:
Mary goes to “TechNews.com” (for example) on the internet. She clicks on 
“Submit A Link” from the top menu and the web site redirects her to a page where she is supposed to enter an URL to her article and title to be displayed for that link. Mary does put the URL to her article and title at the two empty input fields after that she presses “Save” button. The website redirects her immediately to the front page/the first page that loads and she can see her posted link and its title at the top of all other links.

Contributors:  Yoana Dandarova & Manish Shrestha


----------


This (made up) SLA with the Group H includes the following commitment from us (Group G):

 - Maximum of 20 minutes of downtime per day (if any)
 - Response time of under an hour
 - Debugging and maintenance within 24 hours of (bug) reporting
 - Access to monitoring of system.

The SLA metric, powered by Prometheus + Grafana, can be accessed from the following link:

> Log in credentials is the default. *hint* **admin x 2** *hint*

Grafana linked to the project portrays 4 graphs:

 1. Up time of the system
 2. Total Active Requests
 3. Total CPU process usage
 4. HTTP request duration (in ms)
